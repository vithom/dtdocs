      <description>The darktable binary starts darktable with its GUI and full functionality. This is the standard way to use darktable.
darktable can called with the following command line parameters:
darktable [-d {all,cache,camctl,camsupport,control,dev, fswatch,input,lighttable,lua,masks,memory,nan, opencl,perf,pwstorage,print,sql,ioporder, imageio,undo,signal}] [&amp;lt;input file&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;image folder&amp;gt;] [--version] [--disable-opencl] [--library &amp;lt;library file&amp;gt;] [--datadir &amp;lt;data directory&amp;gt;] [--moduledir &amp;lt;module directory&amp;gt;] [--tmpdir &amp;lt;tmp directory&amp;gt;] [--configdir &amp;lt;user config directory&amp;gt;] [--cachedir &amp;lt;user cache directory&amp;gt;] [--localedir &amp;lt;locale directory&amp;gt;] [--luacmd &amp;lt;lua command&amp;gt;] [--noiseprofiles &amp;lt;noiseprofiles json file&amp;gt;] [--d-signal &amp;lt;signal&amp;gt;] [--d-signal-act &amp;lt;all,raise,connect,disconnect,print-trace&amp;gt;] [--conf &amp;lt;key&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;] [-t &amp;lt;num openmp threads&amp;gt;] All parameters are optional.</description>

      <description>Photography has a long history of producing monochrome images, and many still enjoy this aspect of photography. While there are some specialised/modified cameras with a truly monochrome sensor, most still use a regular camera to capture a color image, and turn it into a monochrome image during post-processing.
There are two main approaches this conversion:
  A physical approach, where we attempt to simulate how a silver-based photographic film emulsion would react to the light captured at the scene.</description>

      <description>The basic element for organizing images in darktable is called a film roll – a kind of virtual folder. Whenever you import images from the filesystem, the images are organized in a film roll whose name is derived from the name of their parent folder. Re-importing a folder will add any new images to the existing film roll; images already present in the film roll are not reimported (though the contents of their XMP sidecar files are reloaded into the library database).</description>

      <description>When you want to edit some new images in darktable, the first step is to import them. This will create entries for the imported images in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database so it can keep track of the changes you make to them. There are two main methods for importing images:
 import images from the filesystem You can import a single image or a directory full of images (optionally recursing through subdirectories) from the filesystem.</description>

      <description>At the top of each processing module is the module header.
  Click on the module name to expand the module and display the parameters that control its operation.
By default darktable will only allow one processing module to be expanded at a time &amp;ndash; if you click the header of another module, the previously-opened module&amp;rsquo;s controls are collapsed. If you want to expand more than one module, you may expand further modules by Shift+clicking on the header and all previously expanded modules will remain open.</description>

      <description>Masks allow you to limit the effect of a module so that it only applies to certain parts of the image.
A mask can be regarded as a grayscale image where each pixel has a value between 0 and 1.0 (or between 0% and 100%). This value is used to determine how much a module affects each pixel.
The following sections explain how to construct masks in darktable.</description>

      <description>By default each module takes its input from the preceding module in the pixelpipe, performs its operation on the image data, and hands the output over to the next module in the pixelpipe.
A module&amp;rsquo;s output data can optionally be reprocessed (combined) with its input data before being handed to the next module. This additional processing step is called blending. Input and output data is reprocessed using algorithms called blending operators or blend modes.</description>

      <description>The map view is where you geo-tag your images.
Map view shows a world map with the currently open image or film roll of images, pinned to their geo-tagged location. This requires that the image was geo-tagged by a camera with that feature. Some newer cameras, including smartphones, are already equipped with GPS receivers. Other cameras may need additional GPS hardware to do this.
Even if your camera doesn&amp;rsquo;t support this feature, there is an alternative method &amp;ndash; darktable can match the Exif time and date data in your image(s) to a separate GPX data tracking file created by a GPS tracker recording your movements.</description>

      <description>The modules in this reference section are broken down into two types:
 processing modules These modules are used exclusively in the darkroom view, and each performs its processing operation on the image before passing the image up to the next module for further processing. Together this sequence of processing steps forms the pixelpipe. utility modules These modules may be used in any darktable view. They are not directly involved in processing the pixels of your image; instead they perform other ancillary functions related to managing the image metadata and tags, editing history, modifying overall pixel pipeline order, snapshots and duplicates, image export and so on.</description>

      <description>darktable employs a fully color managed workflow:
  Input color specifications are taken from embedded or user-supplied ICC profiles or &amp;ndash; in the case of raw files &amp;ndash; from a library of camera-specific color matrices.
  darktable automatically reads the display profile of your monitor (if properly configured) for accurate on-screen color rendition. Multi-screen setups are fully supported as long as a system service like colord is in place and properly set up to inform darktable of the correct monitor profile.</description>

      <description>darktable-chart is a tool for extracting luminance and color values out of images taken from color reference cards such as IT8.7/1 charts. Its main purpose is to compare a source image (typically a largely unprocessed raw image) to a target image (typically a JPEG image created in-camera) and produce a darktable style that is able to use the luminance and color values of the source image to produce the target image.</description>

      <description>darktable is a non-destructive image editor and opens all images in read-only mode. Any data created within darktable (metadata, tags, and image processing steps) are stored in separate .XMP sidecar files. These files allow darktable to store information about the images as well as the full editing history without touching the original raw files. When you import an image into darktable for the first time, an XMP file is automatically generated (XMP generation can be disabled in preferences &amp;gt; storage but this is not recommended in normal use).</description>

      <description>The basic element of image processing in darktable is the processing module. In order to process a raw image a number of such modules act on the input image in sequence, each performing a different operation on the image data. For those familiar with Adobe Photoshop, the concept of a processing module in darktable is analagous to that of an adjustment layer in that both make an incremental adjustment to the image, building on top of the adjustments that came before.</description>

      <description>Processing high resolution images is a demanding task needing a modern computer. Both in terms of memory requirements and CPU power, getting the best out of a typical 15, 20 or 25 Megapixel image can quickly take your computer to its limits.
darktable&amp;rsquo;s requirements are no exception. All calculations are performed on 4 x 32bit floating point numbers. This is slower than “ordinary” 8 or 16 bit integer algebra, but eliminates all problems of tonal breaks or loss of information.</description>

      <description>At startup, darktable will automatically run the Lua scripts $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/luarc and $HOME/.config/darktable/luarc (where $DARKTABLE represents the darktable installation directory and $HOME represents your home directory).
This is the only time darktable will run Lua scripts by itself. These scripts can register callbacks to perform actions on various darktable events. This callback mechanism is the primary method of triggering lua actions.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/darkroom/masking-and-blending/blend-modes/</guid>
      <description>Blend modes define how the input and output of a module are combined (blended) together before a module&amp;rsquo;s final output is passed to the next module in the pixelpipe.
Classic blending modes, designed for display-referred RGB (constrained to 0-100%) implicitly define a fulcrum at 50% (gray) or 100% (white) in their algorithms, depending on the blend mode. Because scene-referred is not subject to these restrictions, this fulcrum needs to be explicitly defined by the user when performing blending operations in the &amp;ldquo;RGB (scene)&amp;rdquo; color space.</description>

      <description>A collection is a set of images defined by a specific combination of selection criteria. The most basic kind of collection is a film roll, which contains all of the images that have been imported from a specific folder on disk.
You can easily construct other kinds of collections based on various image attributes (Exif data, filename, tags etc.). Multiple criteria can be logically combined to narrow or extend your collection (see collect images).</description>

      <description>The darktable-cli binary starts the command line interface variant of darktable which allows images to be exported.
This variant does not open any display &amp;ndash; it works in pure console mode without launching a GUI. This mode is particularly useful for servers running background jobs.
darktable-cli can be called with the following command line parameters:
darktable-cli [&amp;lt;input file or folder&amp;gt;] [&amp;lt;xmp file&amp;gt;] &amp;lt;output file or folder&amp;gt; [--width &amp;lt;max width&amp;gt;] [--height &amp;lt;max height&amp;gt;] [--bpp &amp;lt;bpp&amp;gt;] [--hq &amp;lt;0|1|true|false&amp;gt;] [--upscale &amp;lt;0|1|true|false&amp;gt;] [--style &amp;lt;style name&amp;gt;] [--style-overwrite] [--apply-custom-presets &amp;lt;0|1|false|true&amp;gt;] [--out-ext &amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;] [--import &amp;lt;file or dir&amp;gt;] [--icc-type &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;] [--icc-file &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;] [--icc-intent &amp;lt;intent&amp;gt;] [--verbose] [--help [option]] [--core &amp;lt;darktable options&amp;gt;] The user must supply an input filename and an output filename.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/color-management/display-profile/</guid>
      <description>For darktable to faithfully render colors on screen it needs to find the correct display profile for your monitor. In general this requires your monitor to be properly calibrated and profiled, and it needs the profile to be correctly installed on your system. darktable queries your X display server&amp;rsquo;s xatom as well as the system service colord (if available) for the right profile. If required you can enforce a specific method in preferences &amp;gt; miscellaneous.</description>

      <description>With the drawn mask feature you can construct a mask by drawing shapes directly onto the image canvas. Shapes can be used alone or in combination. Once a shape has been drawn on an image it can be adjusted, removed, or reused in other modules.
Shapes are stored internally as vector graphics and are rendered with the required resolution during pixelpipe processing. Shapes are expressed in the coordinate system of the original image and are transformed along with the rest of the image by any active distorting modules in the pipe (lens correction, crop &amp;amp; rotate for example).</description>

      <description>This section will guide you through the basics of developing an image in the darkroom view, where an arsenal of modules is at hand to help you reach your creative goals.
To begin, open an image in the darkroom by double clicking an image thumbnail in the lighttable view.
Each change you make to the image in the darkroom is turned into a history stack item. The history is stored in a database and in an XMP sidecar file for that image.</description>

      <description>As you can imagine, the hardware architecture of GPUs can vary significantly. There are different manufacturers, and even different generations of GPUs from the same manufacturer may not be comparable. At the same time GPU manufacturers don&amp;rsquo;t normally disclose all the hardware details of their products to the public. One of the consequences of this is the need to use proprietary drivers under Linux, if you want to take full advantage of your graphics card.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/overview/sidecar-files/sidecar-import/</guid>
      <description>When importing an image, darktable automatically checks if it is accompanied by a sidecar file. As well as looking for files named &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;.xmp and &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;_nn.&amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;.xmp (darktable&amp;rsquo;s XMP file naming formats) darktable also checks for the presence of a file in the form &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;.xmp (the naming format for Lighroom&amp;rsquo;s XMP sidecar files). Files with the latter naming format will be read by darktable but will not be written to. Once the image has been imported, darktable will generate an additional XMP file using its own naming convention.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/memory/</guid>
      <description>darktable&amp;rsquo;s memory requirements are high. A simple calculation makes this clear. If you have a 20MPx image then, for precision reasons, darktable will store this internally as a 4 x 32-bit floating point cell for each pixel. Each full image of this size will therefore need about 300MB of memory. As we want to process the image, we will at least need two buffers for each module – one for input and one for output.</description>

      <description>Many of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules can be applied more than once in the pixelpipe. Each instance of a module behaves independently, taking its input from the module below in the pixelpipe delivering its output to the module above.
As with the base instance of a module, all instances can be moved independently within the pixelpipe either by holding Ctrl+Shift while dragging &amp;amp; dropping or by choosing &amp;ldquo;move up&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;move down&amp;rdquo; in the multiple instances drop-down menu.</description>

The order of the pixelpipe is represented graphically by the order in which modules are presented in the user interface &amp;ndash; the pixelpipe starts with a RAW image at the bottom of the list, and applies the processing modules one by one, piling up layer upon layer of processing from the bottom up, until it reaches the top of the list, where it outputs the fully processed image.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple example which will print some code on the console. Create a file called luarc in darktable&amp;rsquo;s configuration directory (usually $HOME/.config/darktable/) and add the following line to it:
print(&amp;quot;Hello World !&amp;quot;) Start darktable and you will see the sentence &amp;ldquo;Hello World !&amp;rdquo; printed on the console. Nothing fancy but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.
At this point, there is nothing darktable-specific in the script. We simply use Lua&amp;rsquo;s standard print function to print a string.</description>

      <description>Using OpenCL in darktable requires that your PC is equipped with a suitable graphics card and that it has the required libraries in place. Most modern graphics cards from NVIDIA and AMD come with full OpenCL support. The OpenCL compiler is normally shipped as part of the proprietary graphics driver and is used as a dynamic library called libOpenCL.so. This library must be in a folder where it can be found by your system&amp;rsquo;s dynamic linker.</description>

      <title>editing an image: scene-referred workflow</title>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/overview/workflow/edit-scene-referred/</guid>
      <description>The scene-referred workflow places an emphasis on performing image processing in the linear scene-referred part of the pixelpipe. This helps to reduce artifacts and color shifts that can result from processing non-linear pixel values and, by decoupling the image processing from the characteristics of a specific display, it makes it easier to adapt your work in the future to new display media, such as high dynamic range displays.
This being the recommended way to process images in versions 3.</description>

      <description>This section contains examples of typical usages of tethering.
🔗studio setup with screening This is a pretty common use case. You have your studio and subject set up, the camera is connected to your computer and tethering view is active in darktable. You work at the camera and take images. Whenever you like, you can screen the image directly on your computer monitor instead of using the camera LCD for validation.</description>

      <description>The filmstrip, when enabled, is shown at the bottom of the screen (except in the lighttable view, where it is replaced with the timeline module) and displays the images from the collection that is currently selected in the lighttable view. You can navigate along the filmstrip by scrolling with the mouse wheel.
The filmstrip allows you to interact with images while you are not in the lighttable view. For example, while developing an image in darkroom mode, you can switch to another image to by clicking its thumbnail in the filmstrip.</description>

      <description>Many users have huge image collections stored on extra hard drives in their desktop computer, or on an external storage medium like a RAID NAS, etc.
It is a common requirement to be able to develop a number of images while travelling using a laptop and then later synchronize them back to the original storage medium. However, copying images manually from the main storage to the laptop and back is cumbersome and prone to errors.</description>

      <description>The parametric mask feature offers fine-grained selective control over how individual pixels are masked. It does this by automatically generating an intermediate blend mask from user-defined parameters. These parameters are color coordinates rather than the geometrical coordinates used in drawn masks.
For each data channel of a module (Lab, RGB) and several virtual data channels (e.g. hue, saturation) you can construct a per-channel opacity function. Depending on each pixel&amp;rsquo;s value for a given data channel this function calculates a blending factor between 0 and 1 (100%) for that pixel.</description>

      <description>darktable can render colors either with its internal algorithms or by using the external library LittleCMS2. darktable&amp;rsquo;s internal method is, by an order of magnitude, faster than the external one. The external option gives you a choice of the rendering intent and might offer a slightly higher accuracy in some cases.
You can change the default method in preferences &amp;gt; processing &amp;gt; always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile</description>

      <description>This is a legacy mode which is retained to provide backward-compatibility with edits in older darktable versions, and to allows users to continue with their former way of working without forcing them to use the newer scene-referred workflow.
The display-referred workflow places more emphasis on performing image processing in the non-linear display-referred part of the pixelpipe. By default it uses the base curve module to tone map images from the linear scene-referred space into display-referred space, although other tone-mapping tools (such as the tone curve module) can also be used.</description>

Thanks to this recording process it is possible to undo and redo changes to recover a previous editing state. Note that the undo/redo facility is unlimited in the number of steps while editing an image, but is reset each time the darkroom is switched to a new image.
Press Ctrl+Z to undo the last modification and Ctrl+Y to redo the last undone modification (if any).</description>

      <description>So far, all our scripts have done things during startup. This is of limited use and doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow us to react to real user actions. To do more advanced things we need to register a function that will be called on a given event. The most common event to react to is a keyboard shortcut.
darktable = require &amp;quot;darktable&amp;quot; local function hello_shortcut(event, shortcut) darktable.print(&amp;quot;Hello, I just received &#39;&amp;quot;..event.. &amp;quot;&#39; with parameter &#39;&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>darktable&amp;rsquo;s input images are either RGB files (like JPEGs or TIFFs) or camera RAWs. Both store visual information as a combination of primary colors (such as red, green and blue) which together describe a light emission to be later recreated by a display.
The following image illustrates this concept.
  On the left-hand-side of the image is a colored light that we need to represent digitally. Using three ideal color filters, we can decompose this light into three colored primary lights at different intensities.</description>

      <description>Changes to an image are not saved directly to the image file contrary to a regular image editor. Rather, darktable is a non-destructive editor, which means that all changes are recorded in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database, and the original image is left untouched. Therefore, you need to export images in order to bake your processing options and metadata changes into an output file that can be distributed outside of darktable.
Images are exported using the export module which is available in the lighttable and darkroom views.</description>

      <description>darktable will detect OpenCL run-time errors automatically. On detecting an error, it will then reprocess everything on the CPU. While this will slow down processing it should not affect the end result.
There can be various reasons why OpenCL might fail during the initialization phase. OpenCL depends on hardware requirements and on the presence of certain drivers and libraries. In addition all these have to fit in terms of maker model and revision number.</description>

      <description>Wavelets are a technique used in image processing to separate (or decompose) an image into a number of distinct layers, each containing a different level of detail. After decomposing an image in this way, a module can limit its processing to one or more of these detail layers, and then piece the layers back together again at the end to form its output image. This allows us to be surgical about which features in the image we wish to impact when working with a module.</description>

      <description>While NVIDIA devices and most modern AMD/ATI devices will often run out of the box, there is more to do for older AMD/ATI graphics cards, namely those prior to the HD7xxx series. This starts with the fact that those devices will only report part of their total GPU memory to darktable. For a 1GB device this typically amounts to only 512MB, a value which darktable in its standard configuration will refuse as insufficient.</description>

If you are able to upload an image to a service via the command line then you can use lua to integrate this into darktable&amp;rsquo;s user interface.
In this next example we will use lua to export via scp. A new storage type will appear in darktable&amp;rsquo;s UI which will export images to a remote target via the copy mechanism in ssh.</description>

🔗metadata Metadata (e.g. title, description) is free-format text that usually differs for each image.
See the metadata editor module for details of how to add metadata to images.

      <description>As described in the previous sections, the final output of a module&amp;rsquo;s mask (the combined effect of any drawn and parameteric masks) is a grayscale raster image representing the extent to which the module&amp;rsquo;s effect should be applied to each pixel. This raster image is stored internally for active modules and can be subsequently reused within other modules in the pixelpipe.
As with any mask, if the value for a pixel in a raster mask is zero the input to the module is passed in the module&amp;rsquo;s output unchanged.</description>

      <description>Screens and most image file formats can only encode RGB intensities confined within a certain range. For example, images encoded on 8 bits can only contain values from 0 to 255, images on 10 bits from 0 to 1023, and so on… Graphic standards postulate that the maximum of that range, no matter its actual value, will always represent the maximum brightness that the display medium is able to render, usually between 100 and 160 Cd/m² (or nits) depending on the actual standard.</description>

Performance in this context mostly means the latency of darktable during interactive work, i.e. how long it takes to reprocess the pixelpipe. For a comfortable workflow it is essential to keep latency low.
In order to obtain profiling info you need to start darktable from a terminal with darktable -d opencl -d perf.</description>

      <description>There are some infrequent situations which still can lead to problematic results unless the user takes some action. Some modules in Lab color space, like levels and monochrome, need to rely on the fact that the L channels carries all lightness information, with the a and b channels purely representing chroma and hue. Unbounded colors with negative L values are especially problematic to these modules and can lead to black pixel artifacts.</description>

      <description>The following options control how images are processed.
 always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile If this option is activated, darktable will use the LittleCMS 2 system library to apply the output color profile instead of its own internal routines. This is significantly slower than the default but might give more accurate results in some cases.  If the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this configuration parameter&amp;rsquo;s value (default off).</description>

🔗Definitions Color properties like &amp;ldquo;saturation&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;brightness&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lightness&amp;rdquo; have passed to common usage but are largely misused and often used to mean different things. In color science, each of these terms has a precise meaning.

      <description>Most image processing applications come from the 1990s and/or inherit a 1990s workflow. These applications processed images encoded with 8 bit unsigned integers because it was more memory and computationally efficient. However, due to the use of an integer format (which implies rounding errors) they had to apply a &amp;ldquo;gamma&amp;rdquo; (essentially a transfer function applying a power 1/2.2 or 1/2.4 to encode the RGB values) and increase the bit-depth in the low-lights in order to reduce rounding errors there (humans are very sensitive to low-light details).</description>

      <description>darktable can use the CPU and one or several OpenCL capable GPUs. Depending on the relative performance of these devices, users can choose among certain scheduling profiles to optimize performance. This is achieved by setting the configuration parameter preferences &amp;gt; cpu/gpu/memory &amp;gt; OpenCL scheduling profile which offers the following choices:
 default If an OpenCL capable GPU is found darktable uses it for processing the center image view while the navigation preview window is processed on the CPU in parallel.</description>

      <description>It is possible to send a lua command to darktable via its DBus interface. The method org.darktable.service.Remote.Lua takes a single string parameter which is interpreted as a lua command. The command will be executed in the current lua context and should return either nil or a string. The result will be passed back as the result of the DBus method.
If the Lua call results in an error, the DBus method call will return an error org.</description>

It is included in the user manual so that you can see how the page is rendered as well as how it is written. Please go to GitHub to see the source for this page.
The manual structure and content have been carefully considered based on the following critera:
 The manual should be comprehensive &amp;ndash; it should describe all of the functionality available in darktable It should have a consistent and logical structure and every piece of functionality should have its own logical place within that structure It should be as long as necessary but as short as possible &amp;ndash; brevity is a must It should be objective Functionality should be explained once and only once (with the exception of the basic workflow guidelines in the overview section) Images should be included only where necessary to improve understanding of key principles and should not contain text unless it is unavoidable  We are generally not interested in:</description>

      <description>This preference tab contains mostly performance-related settings:
 memory in megabytes to use for thumbnail cache In order to speed-up the display of film rolls, darktable stores image thumbnails in a cache file on disk (primary cache) and loads it into memory at startup. This setting controls the size of the cache in megabytes. It needs a restart if changed (default 256MB). enable disk backend for thumbnail cache If activated, darktable stores all thumbnails on disk as a secondary cache, and thereby keeps thumbnails accessible if they get dropped from the primary cache.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/special-topics/opencl/multiple-devices/</guid>
      <description>The scheduling of OpenCL devices on most systems can be optimized using the “OpenCL scheduling profile” settings. However, if your system is equipped with more than one GPU you might want to set the relative device priority manually. To do this you need to select the “default” scheduling profile and change the settings in the “opencl_device_priority” configuration parameter.
It is important to understand how darktable uses OpenCL devices. Each processing sequence of an image – to convert an input to the final output using a history stack – is run in a pixelpipe.</description>

      <description>As has been mentioned, OpenCL systems come with a huge variety of setups: different GPU manufacturers and models, varying amounts of GPU memory, different drivers, different distributions etc..
Many of the potential problems will only appear with very specific combinations of these factors. As the darktable developers only have access to a small fraction of these variations, please understand that we might not be able to fix your specific problem. There is not much we can do if we are unable to reproduce your issue.</description>

      <description>Warning: This feature is very experimental. It is known that several elements don&amp;rsquo;t yet work in library mode. Careful testing is highly recommended.
The lua interface allows you to use darktable from any lua script. This will load darktable as a library and provide you with most of the lua API (darktable is configured headless, so the functions relating to the user interface are not available).
As an example, the following program will print the list of all images in your library:</description>

      <description>Remove image noise while preserving structure.
This is accomplished by averaging each pixel with some surrounding pixels in the image. The weight of such a pixel in the averaging process depends on the similarity of its neighborhood with the neighborhood of the pixel being denoised. A patch with a defined size is used to measure that similarity.
As denoising is a resource-intensive process, it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly. Consider activating this module late in your workflow.</description>

      <description>Entferne Bildrauschen und behalte die Struktur.
Das wird erreicht durch Bilden eines Durchschnittswertes für jedes Pixels mit einigen umgebenden Pixeln im Bild. Der Wert eines solchen Pixels im Prozess der Durchschnittsbildung hängt von der Ähnlichkeit der benachbarten Pixel ab. Eine Fläche mit einer definierten Größe wird für die Bestimmung dieser Ähnlichkeit benutzt.
Entrauschen ist ein speicherintensiver Prozess, es verlangsamt den Pixelpipe-Prozess beträchtlich. Es soll also erst spät im Arbeitsablauf gemacht werden.</description>

      <description>Correct chromatic aberrations.
As this module operates on non-demosaiced raw data, the underlying model assumes an uncropped photographic image as input. It is therefore likely to fail when you zoom in, as it is only able to operate on the visible portion of the image. The module will therefore be bypassed at high zoom levels, and a &amp;ldquo;bypassed&amp;rdquo; message will appear at the top of the module. This limitation only applies to interactive work and not to the final export.</description>

      <description>When an image is sent to a display device, each pixel is normally represented as a set of 3 numbers, representing the intensity of the red, green and blue primary colors in the output color space. Because the output color space is usually closely related to hardware with physical limations, there is a maximum permitted value for the [R,G,B] channels, representing the maximum available intensity for that color space. Similarly, there is also a minimum value below which pixel values will be mapped to zero.</description>

      <description>When developing an image, the way we perceive brightness, contrast and saturation is influenced by the surrounding ambient conditions. If an image is displayed against a dark background, as with the default theme in darktable, it can have the a number of adverse effects on our perception of that image:
 Exaggeration of the perceived exposure makes the image seems brighter than it really is. This is nicely illustrated by the Adelson checkerboard shadow effect.</description>

      <description>A versatile tool for adjusting the image&amp;rsquo;s color balance.
This module can be used to revert parasitic color casts or to enhance the visual atmosphere of an image using color grading, a popular technique in the cinema industry.
🔗overview The color balance module allows you to shift colors selectively by luminance range: shadows, mid-tones, and highlights. It does so using two different methods:
 lift, gamma, gain the classic method, which allows a more separated control of shadows versus highlights.</description>

      <description>A fully-featured color-space correction, white balance adjustment and channel mixer. This simple yet powerful module can be used in the following ways:
  To adjust the white balance (chromatic adaptation), working in tandem with the white balance module. In this case, the white balance module performs an initial white balance step (which is still required in order for the demosaic module to work effectively). The color calibration module then calculates a more perceptually-accurate white balance after the input color profile has been applied.</description>

      <description>Recover color information in blown-out highlights.
Due to the nature of digital sensors, overexposed highlights lack valid color information. Most frequently they appear neutral white or exhibit some color cast &amp;ndash; depending on what other image processing steps are involved. This module can “heal” overexposed highlights by replacing their colors with better fitting ones. The module acts on pixels whose luminance exceeds a user-defined threshold. Replacement colors are taken from neighboring pixels.</description>

      <description>An easy to use and highly efficient denoise module, adapted to the noise profiles of specific camera sensors.
One issue with a lot of denoising algorithms is that they assume that the variance of the noise is independent of the luminosity of the signal. By profiling the noise characteristics of a camera&amp;rsquo;s sensor at different ISO settings, the variance at different luminosities can be assessed, and the denoising algorithm can be adjusted to more evenly smooth out the noise.</description>

      <description>Das Dunstentfernungsmodul ist so konzipiert, dass es automatisch die Wirkung von Staub und Dunst in der Luft reduziert, was häufig den Farbkontrast bei Landschaftsaufnahmen reduziert. Generell kann dieses Modul eingesetzt werden, um Bilder speziell in kontrastarmen Bildbereichen farbintensiver zu gestalten.
Der Dunst absorbiert das Licht, welches sich von den Objekten in Richtung Kamera nähert, ist aber auch eine Quelle für diffuses Hintergrundlicht. Das Modul zur Dunstentfernung schätzt für jeden Bildbereich die Dunstmenge der Szene ab und entfernt anschließend das diffuse Hintergrundlicht entsprechend seiner lokalen Stärke und stellt das ursprüngliche Objektlicht wieder her.</description>

🔗Bayer Filter Kurz gesagt, die Sensorzellen einer Digitalkamera sind nur in der Lage unterschiedliche Helligkeitsstufen, nicht aber unterschiedliche Farben zu erfassen. Um ein Farbbild zu erhalten, wird jede Zelle mit einem Farbfilter abgedeckt, entweder in Rot, Grün oder Blau, die hauptsächlich Licht dieser Farbe durchlassen, was bedeutet, dass jedes Pixel eines RAW-Bildes ausschließlich Informationen einer Farbe enthalten.
Die Filter sind in einem bestimmten Mosaik angeordnet, dem sogenannten Bayer-Muster.</description>

      <description>Dieses Modul wird verwendet, um hochauflösende ISO-Bilder zu entrauschen, angelehnt an die Rausch-Profile spezifischer Kameras.
Ein Resultat einer großen Reihe von Entrauschungs-Algorithmen ist es, dass die Abweichung des Rauschens unabhängig der Helligkeit des Signals ist. Beim Erstellen der Rauschcharakteristiken einer Kamera bei unterschiedlichen ISO Werten, kann die Abweichung verschiedener Helligkeiten beurteilt werden und der Entrauschungs-Algorithmus kann so eingestellt werden, dass das Rauschen gleichmäßiger geglättet werden kann.
Gegenwärtig hat darktable Rauschprofile von über 300 populären Kameras aller Marken.</description>

This module has two modes of operation:
 manual Set the exposure, black level and clipping threshold manually automatic (RAW images only) Use an analysis of the image&amp;rsquo;s histogram to automatically set the exposure. Darktable automatically selects the exposure compensation that is required to shift the selected percentile to the selected target level (see definitions below). This mode is particularly useful for automatically altering a large number of images to have the same exposure.</description>

Falls ein Bild mit einem dunkeln Hintergrund gezeigt wird, wie mit der Normalmaske in darktable, kann das diverse nachteilige Effekte auf die Wahrnehmung dieses Bildes haben:
  Übertreibungen der wahrgenommenen Darstellung lassen das Bild heller erscheinen, als es wirklich ist. Gut dargestellt wird das in Adelson checkerboard shadow effect.
  Eine Verminderung der wahrgenommenen Sättigung im Bild wird die Farben weniger leuchtend erscheinen lassen, als diese in Wirklichkeit sind (Hunt Effekt).</description>

      <description>Take color samples from the current darkroom image, display their values in multiple ways and compare colors from different locations.
The color picker is activated by pressing the color picker icon. The module&amp;rsquo;s parameters will remain in effect until you leave the darkroom mode.
Besides the global color picker described here, many darktable modules (e.g. tone curve) also contain local color pickers which are used to set individual module parameters. You should be aware that these two forms of color picker do not always work in the same color space.</description>

      <description>Please note that this module is deprecated in darktable 3.4 and should no longer be used for new edits. Please use the filmic rgb module instead.
 Compress the tonal range of an HDR image into the limited tonal range of a typical LDR output file.
Global tonemap processes each pixel of an HDR image, without taking the local surrounding into account. This is generally faster than local tone mapping (deprecated), but might lead to less convincing results with very high-dynamic-range scenes.</description>

Globales Tonemap bearbeitet jedes Pixel eines HDR Bildes, ohne die umgebenden zu berücksichtigen. Das ist normalerweise schneller als lokale tone mapping (veraltet), aber es führt zu weniger aussagekräftigen Resultaten in ausgeprägten HDR Szenen.</description>

If these pixels are left partially clipped it can result in unrealistic colors appearing in the image. For example pixels with both green and blue channels clipped will appear to be red without any highlight reconstruction.
Three methods of reconstruction are available:
 clip highlights Clamp all pixels to the white level (i.e. clip the remaining color channels).</description>

      <description>The input color profile module defines how darktable will interpret the colors of the image. It takes the color space used by the source of the image (e.g. camera, scanner) and converts the pixel encodings to a standardised working color space. This means that subsequent modules in the pipeline don&amp;rsquo;t need to be concerned with the specifics of the input device, and can work with and convert to/from the working color space.</description>

      <description>Füge eine Korrekturkurve zu den Bilddaten. Das wird notwendig, falls du ein Input-Profil angewählt hast im Modul Eingabe Farbprofil.
Falls du entscheidest ein ICC Profil des Kameraherstellers im Modul Eingabe Farbprofil zu nutzen, wird es häufig nötig vorgängig eine Korrekturkurve den Bilddaten, um zu verhindern, dass das Ausgangsbild zu dunkel wird. Das wird nicht nötig sein, wenn du die Standard- Matrizen von darktable nutzest.
Die Korrekturkurve wird definiert mit einem linearen Teil aus den Schatten zu einer oberen Grenze und einer Gamme-Kurve, welche die mittleren Bereiche abdeckt.</description>

      <description>Simulate human lowlight vision making pictures look closer to human lowlight perception. This module can also be used to perform a day-to-night conversion.
The idea is to calculate a scotopic vision image, which is perceived by the rods rather than than the cones in the eyes under low light. Scotopic lightness is then mixed with photopic value (regular color image pixel) using some blending function. This module is also able to simulate the Purkinje effect by adding some blueness to the dark parts of the image.</description>

      <description>Automatically correct for converging lines, a form of perspective distortion. The underlying mechanism is inspired by Markus Hebel&amp;rsquo;s ShiftN program.
Perspective distortions are a natural effect when projecting a three dimensional scene onto a two dimensional plane and cause objects close to the viewer to appear larger than objects further away. Converging lines are a special case of perspective distortions frequently seen in architectural photographs. Parallel lines, when photographed at an angle, are transformed into converging lines that meet at some vantage point within or outside of the image frame.</description>

      <description>Adjust black, white and mid-gray points in RGB color space. This module is silmilar to the levels module, which works in Lab color space.
The rgb levels tool shows a histogram of the image, and displays three bars with handles. Drag the handles to modify the black, middle-gray and white points in lightness (in &amp;ldquo;RGB, linked channels&amp;rdquo; mode) or independently for each of the R, G and B channels (in &amp;ldquo;RGB, independent channels&amp;rdquo; mode).</description>

      <description>The sensors of some cameras (such as the Fujifilm FinePix S2Pro, F700, and E550) have a diagonally oriented Bayer pattern instead of the usual orthogonal layout.
Without correction this would lead to a tilted image with black corners. This module applies the required rotation.
darktable detects images that need correction using their Exif data and automatically activates this module where required. For other images the module always remains disabled.
The module has no controls.</description>

This module can be used to denoise images, however you should be aware that bilateral filters are susceptible to overshoots and darktable offers much better alternatives. For example, the astrophoto denoise module uses a non-local means denoising algorithm, and the denoise (profiled) module provides a choice between non-local means and wavelet denoising algorithms.
The surface blur module blurs noise within the surfaces of an image by averaging pixels with their neighbors, taking into account not only their geometric distance but also their distance on the range scale (i.</description>

This module can selectively brighten or darken up to 9 different ranges of luminosity. When used together with filmic rgb, it replaces the need for other tone-mapping modules such as the base curve, shadows and highlights, tone curve and zone system (deprecated) modules. It works in linear RGB space and uses a mask to guide the dodging and burning adjustments, helping to preserve local contrast within the image.</description>

      <description>Please note that this module is deprecated in darktable 3.4 and should no longer be used for new edits. Please use the tone equalizer module instead.
 Compress the tonal range of HDR images so that they fit into the limits of an LDR image, using Durand&amp;rsquo;s 2002 algorithm.
The underlying algorithm uses a bilateral filter to decompose an image into a coarse base layer and a detail layer. The contrast of the base layer is compressed, while the detail layer is preserved, then both layers are re-combined.</description>

      <description>Add a correction curve to image data. This is required if you have selected certain input profiles in the input color profile module.
If you decide to use an ICC profile from the camera manufacturer in the input color profile module, a correction curve frequently needs to be pre-applied to image data to prevent the final output from looking too dark. This extra processing is not required if you use darktable&amp;rsquo;s standard or enhanced color matrices.</description>

      <description>Abfrage und Ändern des Verlaufsstapels des geöffneten Bildes.
Dieses Modul listet jede Änderung des Status (aktivieren/deaktivieren/bewegen/Parameter ändern) aller Bearbeitungsmodule des geöffneten Bildes, die bearbeitet wurden, auf. Du kannst einen Punkt im Verlauf anwählen und zu diesem Punkt der Bearbeitung des Bildes zurückkehren.
 Vorsicht: Anpassungen an irgendeinem Modul verursacht, dass alle Module oberhalb des gewählten, verworfen werden. So kann viel Entwicklungsarbeit leicht verloren gehen.
 Es ist also sicherer in dieser Situation das Programm zu verlassen, oder die Dunkelkammer zu verlassen, oder zu einem anderen Bild zu wechseln.</description>

      <description>Apply a vignetting effect to the image.
Vignetting is a modification of the brightness and saturation at the borders of the image in a specified shape. Many of the parameters listed below can also be modified with a graphical control that overlays the image when the module has focus, showing the shape and extent of the effect.
 Note: This module is known to provoke banding artifacts under certain conditions. You should consider activating the dithering module to alleviate this.</description>

      <description>Wenn ein Bild an einem Bildschirm dargestellt wird, wird normalerweise jedes Pixel als Summe von drei Zahlen dargestellt, die eine Aussage machen über die Intensität der Primärfarben rot, grün und blau im Darstellungs-Farbraum. Weil dieser normalerweise eng verknüpft ist mit der Hardware mit deren physikalischen Grenzen, so gibt es einen Maximalwert für die [R,G,B] Kanäle, der die maximale Intensität für diesen Farbraum repräsentiert. Ähnlich gibt es auch einen Minimalwert, unter dem die Pixel auf null gesetzt werden.</description>

      <description>Render a vector-based overlay onto your image. Watermarks are standard SVG documents and can be designed using Inkscape.
The SVG processor of darktable can also substitute strings within the SVG document, which allows you to include image dependent information in the watermark.
User-designed watermarks should be placed into the directory $HOME/.config/darktable/watermarks. Once in place, use the reload button update the list of available watermarks.
The following is a list of variable strings that are supported for substitution within the SVG document.</description>

      <description>Dieses Modul ist ein künstlerisches Element, das ein weiches Bild erzeugt, das allgemein als Orton-Effekt bekannt ist.
Michael Orton erzielte seine Ergebnisse auf dem Dia-Film, indem er zwei Aufnahmen derselben Szene verwendete: Eine gut belichtete und eine überbelichtete; er benutzte dann eine Dunkelkammertechnik, um diese zu einem endgültigen Bild zu verschmelzen, in dem das überbelichtete Bild verschwommen war.
Dieses Modul ist fast eine Kopie von Ortons analogem Prozess in die digitale Domäne.</description>

      <description>Adjust the white balance of the image by altering the temperature and tint, defining a coefficient for each (RGB) channel, or choosing from list of predefined white balance settings.
The default settings for this module are derived from the camera white balance stored in the image&amp;rsquo;s Exif data.
White balance is not intended as a &amp;ldquo;creative&amp;rdquo; module &amp;ndash; its primary goal is is to technically correct the white balance of the image ensuring that neutral colored objects in the scene are rendered as neutral colors in the image.</description>
